# Tokagentos boot blocked by `@elizaos/plugin-sql@1.7.2` interface skew

**Status**: Open — blocks any HTTP-server-dependent runtime work (chat, dashboard, billing's `/v1/messages` route)
**Severity**: P1 — agent runtime cannot serve requests
**Filed**: 2026-05-16
**Updated**: 2026-05-17 — walls 4 & 5 patched, wall 6 surfaced (different shape: missing optional packages)
**Discovered during**: mainnet rollout of the billing plugin (see `mainnet-deployment.md`)

---

## TL;DR

`packages/agent/src/runtime/tokagent.ts` and `packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts` are built against a richer database-adapter interface than `@elizaos/plugin-sql@1.7.2` (the only currently-installable version) implements. The agent crashes during `initialize()` before the HTTP server starts listening on port 2138. Symptoms appear at **at least four distinct layers**; a generic adapter Proxy shim unblocks three of them, the fourth is a schema-column gap and is not shim-able.

The billing plugin (`@tokagent/plugin-tokagent-billing`) and its Neon backing DB are unaffected — they own their own pg.Pool — but the chat e2e through tokagentos can't run until this is resolved.

---

## What works today (so we know what NOT to break)

- **Mainnet contracts** PTON `0x00D1EDcE8E7c617891FF76224DFf501c568f1Ce0` and ClaudeVault `0x1072f70e7c490E460fA72AC4171F7aDD1ef2d79F` are deployed, verified on Etherscan, and exercised end-to-end via the source `llm-api-gateway/proxy` (which uses better-sqlite3, sidesteps tokagentos entirely).
- **Billing plugin against Neon**: `scripts/billing-boot-smoke.ts` runs in ~800ms — 8 `billing_*` tables created, 3 Drizzle migrations applied, TWAP read succeeds, all 4 workers start, dispose clean. Run with `bun run scripts/billing-boot-smoke.ts` from the repo root.
- **TWAP probe**: `bun run --cwd packages/billing probe-twap` returns TON/USD against live mainnet Uniswap pools.

Anything that depends only on the billing plugin's surface (not the host agent runtime) is solid.

---

## Reproduction

```bash
cd /Users/mehdiberiane/Documents/tokamak/TAL/Tokamak-AI-Layer/tokagentos
# .env is already set with mainnet contracts + Neon URL + LiteLLM key
LOG_LEVEL=info bun run packages/app-core/src/entry.ts start
```

Boot reaches `billing plugin initialized — BILLING_ENABLED=true`, then proceeds into agent runtime initialize() and dies before the API server listens. Port 2138 stays closed.

---

## The four walls (and which we've patched)

Each wall surfaced as the previous one was fixed. The path is:
plugin pre-register → agent runtime initialize → `ensureAgentExists` → `ensureRoomExists` → schema compat check.

### Wall 1 — Missing batch-read methods on the adapter ✅ patched

**Symptom**:
```
TypeError: this.adapter.getAgentsByIds is not a function
TypeError: this.adapter.getWorldsByIds is not a function
```

**Root cause**: `packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts` calls plural batch reads (`getAgentsByIds`, `getWorldsByIds`, `getEntitiesByIds`, …) but `@elizaos/plugin-sql@1.7.2` only ships singular forms (`getAgent`, `getWorld`, `getEntity`).

**Patch**: a JS Proxy wrapper in `runtime.ts` `wrapAdapterWithCompatShim()` that routes plural `get*ByIds([ids])` to `Promise.all(ids.map(getX))` when a matching singular method exists.

### Wall 2 — Bulk-write upsert returning no-op ✅ patched

**Symptom**:
```
Error: Failed to retrieve agent after upsert: 563fa9cb-0557-0793-a81e-f72e8386310f
```

**Root cause**: `runtime.ts:7341` calls `this.adapter.upsertAgents([agentToUpsert])`. The adapter has no `upsertAgents` (or `upsertX` in general). My initial shim returned `[]` as a default, then the immediate `getAgentsByIds([agent.id])` read returned null → throw.

**Patch**: extended the Proxy to recognise `upsert<X>s` / `create<X>s` patterns and route them to singular `createX(item, ...rest)` per element. `upsert` swallows "already exists" errors as no-op.

### Wall 3 — Plural method name mismatch ✅ patched

**Symptom**:
```
Error: Failed to add agent ... as participant to its own room
```

**Root cause**: `runtime.ts:1733` calls `createRoomParticipants(entityIds, roomId)`. Adapter has `addParticipantsRoom(entityIds, roomId)` — different verb, same signature.

**Patch**: explicit `ADAPTER_METHOD_ALIASES` table in the shim. Currently one entry; will grow as more divergent names surface.

### Wall 4 — Database schema columns missing ✅ patched (2026-05-17)

**Symptom**:
```
Error: [sql-compat] Missing required column "trajectories"."step_count"
  (integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0). Run the appropriate database migrations
  before starting the app.
```

**Root cause** (revised after investigation): `packages/app-core/src/utils/sql-compat.ts` was imported verbatim from upstream elizaOS v2.0.0-alpha.223 (commit `23476be4`). The function `addColumnIfMissing` was named to suggest self-healing but the implementation only threw an error. Its parent `ensureRuntimeSqlCompatibility` is called from `repairRuntimeAfterBoot` — both names imply repair, not assertion. The throw was the bug.

**Full inventory of gaps** (read once from `sql-compat.ts:144-162`, not iterated):
- `participants.agent_id` (uuid REFERENCES "agents"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `participants.room_state` (text)
- `trajectories.step_count` (integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)
- `trajectories.llm_call_count` (integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)
- `trajectories.total_prompt_tokens` (integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)
- `trajectories.total_completion_tokens` (integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)
- `trajectories.total_reward` (real NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)
- `trajectories.scenario_id` (text)
- `trajectories.batch_id` (text)

**Patch** (Option E from the original ranking): rewrote `addColumnIfMissing` to do what its name promises:
1. If the column already exists → no-op (unchanged behavior)
2. If the table doesn't exist (column lookup returns empty set) → log warning, skip (treats optional services like `trajectories` as gracefully-absent; matches existing `"trajectories service unavailable"` runtime warning)
3. Otherwise → `ALTER TABLE <table> ADD COLUMN <col> <definition>` with sanitized identifiers

Result on boot: `participants` columns added cleanly to PGLite; `trajectories` table didn't exist so skipped with warning; sql-compat check passes; `AutonomyService started after SQL compatibility repair`.

### Wall 5 — Missing handler files in @tokagentos/agent ✅ patched (2026-05-17)

**Symptom**:
```
ResolveMessage: Cannot find module '@tokagentos/agent/api/cloud-billing-routes'
  from '/Users/.../packages/app-core/src/api/server.ts'
```

**Root cause**: `packages/app-core/src/api/server.ts:6-7` statically imports `handleCloudBillingRoute` from `@tokagentos/agent/api/cloud-billing-routes` and `handleCloudCompatRoute` from `@tokagentos/agent/api/cloud-compat-routes`. Both files **have never existed** in this repo's git history. The imports are stale references — either to features that were removed before being committed, or to features still being designed. They're at module top-level, so they crash before the API server can listen.

**Patch**: created stubs at:
- `packages/agent/src/api/cloud-billing-routes.ts`
- `packages/agent/src/api/cloud-compat-routes.ts`

Both stubs respond `501 Not Implemented` to any matching URL (`/api/cloud/billing/*` and `/api/cloud/compat/*` respectively) and return `true` so the caller treats the path as "handled" without falling through to other dispatchers. The in-plugin billing dashboard at `/v1/billing/dashboard` and the on-chain `/v1/*` routes are unaffected.

### Wall 6 — Incomplete elizaos→tokagentos apps/* cleanup ❌ NOT patched (and not patchable in-session)

**Symptom** (after wall 5 stubs):
```
ResolveMessage: Cannot find module '@tokagentos/app-steward/routes/server-wallet-trade'
  from '/Users/.../packages/app-core/src/api/server.ts'
```

**Investigation finding** (updated 2026-05-17 after deeper dig):

The `tsconfig.json` path mappings in `packages/agent/` and `packages/app-core/` reveal these packages were expected at `apps/app-steward/`, `apps/app-shopify/`, `apps/app-vincent/`, etc. — i.e. **in this monorepo's `apps/` directory**. They're absent because they were **intentionally deleted** by an earlier cleanup pass documented at:

  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-24-tokagentos-elizaos-cleanup-design.md`

That spec lists 16 of 17 `apps/*` directories for deletion (keeping only `app-companion`). The cleanup happened. But the cleanup did **not** strip the dependent imports from the rest of the codebase. The aftermath:

| Where | Count |
|---|---|
| `@tokagentos/app-*` imports in `packages/app-core/src/` | **57** |
| `@tokagentos/app-*` imports in `packages/agent/src/` | **94** |
| **Total stale references** | **151** |
| Packages available on npm | **0** (`npm view @tokagentos/app-steward dist-tags` → 404) |
| Git history of deleted apps in this repo | gone — the delete commit removed them |

**Packages referenced (16)**: `app-steward`, `app-shopify`, `app-vincent`, `app-lifeops`, `app-training`, `app-task-coordinator`, `app-tokagentmaker`, `app-knowledge`, plus the rest from the cleanup spec.

**Affected surface**:
- `app-core/src/App.tsx` (root React component) imports `FineTuningView` from `app-training`
- `app-core/src/components/pages/{ChatView,SettingsView,InventoryView,BrowserWorkspaceView,AdvancedPageView,TasksPageView}.tsx` — chat, settings, inventory, browser, advanced, tasks tabs all import from various app-*
- `app-core/src/api/wallet-{compat,browser-compat}-routes.ts`, `awareness/contributors/wallet.ts`, `config/boot-config-store.ts`, `shell/DetachedShellRoot.tsx` — boot-time + auth-time
- `agent/src/api/server.ts`, `trajectory-routes.ts`, `training-routes.ts`, `knowledge-service-loader.ts`, `registry-service.ts`, `server-helpers-swarm.ts`, `server-types.ts`, `permissions-routes.ts` — agent's HTTP API surface

**Why this is out of scope for a single boot-blocker session**:

The cleanup was a deliberate product decision (delete 16 apps). To complete it cleanly, somebody has to:
1. Remove the 151 import references **and** the code that calls them (some are React components rendered in the UI — removing them changes the product surface)
2. Remove the dead routes (`/api/trajectory/*`, `/api/training/*`, `/api/knowledge/*`, `/api/swarm/*`, etc.)
3. Strip the corresponding tsconfig path mappings
4. Strip from package.json, scaffold-patches, templates

This is a multi-day cleanup, not a shim.

**Three real paths forward**:

  **(a) Restore the apps** — requires access to wherever they actually live (private fork? team's local checkout? archived branch?). Not findable from this workspace. Ask the elizaos-cleanup spec owner.
  **(b) Finish the cleanup** — surgically remove the 151 stale references and accept the product-surface loss (no FineTuningView, no StewardLogo, no ApprovalQueue, no CodingAgentTasksPanel, etc.). Substantial refactor of `app-core` UI.
  **(c) Build stub workspace packages** — create 16 empty `apps/app-*` directories with minimal `package.json` + `src/index.ts` exporting nulls/no-ops. Re-add `apps/*` to root workspaces. Functional UI for those features disappears but boot proceeds. Mechanical, ~half day if scoped well.

**Recommendation**: Option (a) if the apps can be found and the cleanup is being reversed; Option (c) as a tactical unblock if the cleanup is permanent and the UI loss is acceptable; Option (b) for the full clean-house.

Note: Wall 6 is **structurally different** from walls 1–5. Walls 1–5 are version skew between two existing packages — solvable with shims. Wall 6 is a missing-dependency-set problem from an incomplete refactor — only the team that owns the elizaos cleanup spec can decide its resolution.

---

## Root cause (single sentence, updated 2026-05-17)

**This monorepo is configured as the *consumer* of a larger Tokamak / elizaOS distribution it doesn't fully ship — both at the adapter-interface layer (plugin-sql v2 expected, v1.7.2 installable) AND at the workspace-package layer (`@tokagentos/app-{steward,vincent,shopify,lifeops,training}` expected, not present).**

The first half is fixable in-tree via shims (walls 1–5, all patched). The second half is a packaging/distribution gap that requires either pulling in the missing app packages or refactoring the parts of `app-core` that hard-import them.

---

## Recommended fix paths, ranked

### Option A — Fix forward: handwrite migrations to add the missing columns

**Effort**: medium (hours, possibly a day)
**Risk**: low — additive schema changes
**Steps**:
1. Boot tokagentos with auto-shim active. Iterate: each `[sql-compat]` error names one missing column.
2. For each, write a Drizzle migration in a new `packages/agent/src/migrations/<plugin>/00NN_compat_*.sql` that adds the column.
3. Wire it into plugin-sql's migration discovery (or run them out-of-band via `bun run migrate`).
4. Repeat until the compat checker is satisfied and boot completes.
5. Keep the adapter Proxy shim in `runtime.ts` — it's still needed for method gaps.

This is what tokagentos's own runbook (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-litellm-provider-integration-design.md`) implicitly assumes — that adapter columns can be re-aligned via DB migrations.

### Option B — Upgrade `@elizaos/plugin-sql` to 2.0.0-beta.1

**Effort**: small to large, depending on what breaks
**Risk**: medium-high — we tried this once and hit `Cannot find module '@elizaos/plugin-sql' from .../tokagent.ts`. The 2.0.0-beta.1 has an `exports`/`module` layout that doesn't resolve under Bun 1.3.14 + our workspace.

**Steps if you take this path**:
1. Re-add the override:
   ```jsonc
   "overrides": { "@elizaos/plugin-sql": "2.0.0-beta.1" }
   ```
2. Investigate the resolution failure. Likely candidates:
   - The package's `main` field is `src/dist/index.js` but Bun is looking at `node:` export. Verify the exports map handles Bun's resolver correctly.
   - There may need to be a postinstall script that rebuilds the package's TS source.
3. Once resolved, the runtime methods should match — no shim needed.
4. Revert `wrapAdapterWithCompatShim` and the `ADAPTER_METHOD_ALIASES` in `runtime.ts`.

### Option C — Patch the runtime to call only what 1.7.2 provides

**Effort**: large (engineering rewrite)
**Risk**: medium — touches the core runtime; could ripple
**Steps**: edit `packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts` to use singular `getAgent` / `getWorld` / etc. directly, drop `upsertAgents` in favor of an explicit `getAgent → updateAgent || createAgent` dance, etc. Mirrors the v1.x adapter interface from above.

Don't recommend — it's writing tokagentos backwards.

### Option D (escape hatch) — Bypass the sql-compat check

**Effort**: tiny
**Risk**: high — the check exists for a reason; bypassing it lets the agent start but at runtime it'll crash on queries that touch the missing columns

```ts
// packages/agent/src/services/sql-compat.ts or equivalent
if (process.env.TOKAGENT_SKIP_SQL_COMPAT === "1") {
  log.warn("SQL compat check bypassed — runtime queries against missing columns will crash");
  return;
}
```

**Use only** for "I just need the HTTP server to listen so I can probe routes" debugging. Don't ship.

## Files touched by the shim work (revert path if Option B succeeds)

| File | What was changed | Revert cost |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts` | Added `wrapAdapterWithCompatShim()` function (~110 lines, above `class AgentRuntime`) and replaced `registerDatabaseAdapter` body to wrap the adapter through it. Also added `ADAPTER_METHOD_ALIASES` lookup table. | ~115 LoC; clean revert via git |
| `packages/agent/package.json` | Added `@elizaos/plugin-agent-skills: 2.0.0-alpha.537` and `@tokagent/plugin-tokagent-billing: workspace:*` to `dependencies`. | Keep — both are needed regardless |
| Root `package.json` | Added `@ai-sdk/anthropic: 3.0.71` override (fixed nested-anthropic-2.0.79 resolution). Removed `@elizaos/plugin-sql: 2.0.0-beta.1` override after it failed to resolve. | Keep the anthropic override |
| `packages/agent/src/runtime/core-plugins.ts` | Added `@tokagent/plugin-tokagent-billing` to `CORE_PLUGINS`. | Keep |
| `tokagentos/.env` and `~/.tokagent/config.env` | `BILLING_DATABASE_URL` pointed at Neon. Docker-pg backups at `.docker-pg.bak.<ts>`. | Keep |
| Bun version | Globally upgraded 1.2.21 → 1.3.14 (1.2.21 segfaulted on workspace resolution). | Keep |

---

## Test plan once Option A or B lands

1. **Boot smoke**: `bun run packages/app-core/src/entry.ts start` should reach `API server listening on http://0.0.0.0:2138` (or equivalent) without error.
2. **Plugin lifecycle**: `tokagent-billing` plugin must still init cleanly against Neon (we already proved this).
3. **Health check**: `curl http://localhost:2138/healthz` returns 200.
4. **Route mount**: `curl http://localhost:2138/v1/auth/nonce -X POST -d '{"wallet":"0x..."}'` returns a 200 with EIP-712 envelope (proves the billing plugin's routes are reachable through the agent HTTP server).
5. **End-to-end billable chat**: from the existing `apps/app-companion` or via a hand-built fetch in a test, send a `/v1/chat/completions` with an `sk-ai-*` key. Verify a row appears in `billing_call_log` on Neon.
6. **Regression**: re-run the 4 unit-test suites we have passing now — `packages/billing` rates (22), `packages/billing` schema (16), `plugin-tokagent-billing` plugin (216, modulo 2 pre-existing unrelated nonce-test failures), `app-core` x402-send (7).

---

## Open questions for the assignee

1. **Where does the v2-shape adapter interface come from?** Is there a private fork of `@elizaos/plugin-sql` somewhere in Tokamak's infra? If so, publish it (or vendor it).
2. **Is the runtime's expected schema documented anywhere?** A list of expected columns per table would let us write the additive migrations in one pass rather than discovering them one error at a time.
3. **Was tokagentos's runtime ever booted successfully in this repo's current state?** Check git history: was there a known-good Bun + plugin-sql combo before this regression?
4. **Should billing plugin keep its own DB (Neon) or join PGLite?** Today it's separate by design — billing has financial-loss exposure that PGLite's single-file model can't back. Worth confirming with the security/ops owner.

## Closing note

The shim approach taught us this is **fundamentally a packaging problem**, not a logic problem. The runtime is correct, the adapter we have is older. The right fix is to align the two — either pull plugin-sql forward (Option B) or pin migrations to fill the schema gaps (Option A). The current shim should be considered a development-only bridge; **it must not ship to production** because silent no-ops on the methods we haven't reached yet will mask real bugs.

If you're picking this up, start by running the reproduction above with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` — the shim emits debug logs every time it intercepts a missing method, which gives a complete inventory of what the v1.7.2 adapter is missing.
