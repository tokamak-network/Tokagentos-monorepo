# @tokagentos/billing

Web3 credit-billing rail for the tokagentos LLM gateway. Migrated from `llm-api-gateway` in 2026.

The billing package implements a four-component system: PTON token (EIP-3009 wrapper over TON) +
`ClaudeVault` Solidity contract (on-chain credit hub) + a TypeScript billing engine that mediates
`reserve → forward → commit` against a DB-backed ledger (Drizzle + Postgres/PGLite) with periodic
on-chain `consumeCredits` flushes + composite Uniswap V3 TWAP for USD→PTON pricing.

## Status

**Phase 0 (staging) — package not yet built into the workspace graph.**

Phase 1 will create `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and wire into `turbo.json`. Until then, the
files in this directory are pre-staged reference artifacts only:

| Artifact | Purpose | Phase it becomes active |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/_archive/architecture.en.md` | English translation of source architecture doc | Reference only (never "active") |
| `docs/_archive/proxy.en.md` | English translation of source proxy server doc | Reference only |
| `docs/reserve-flow.md` | Reserve→commit sequence diagram from `handleMessages.ts` | Reference only |
| `docs/decisions.md` | Committed answers to integration plan Open Questions | Governance (all phases) |
| `src/chain/addresses.ts` | PTON + ClaudeVault deployed addresses | Phase 3 (chain layer) |

**Source-of-truth note**: When `_archive/*.en.md` disagrees with
`llm-api-gateway/proxy/src/*.ts`, **code wins** (per plan Risk R9).
The translated docs are archived reference material; the proxy TypeScript source is
authoritative for all behavioral claims.

## Integration Plan

Full phased integration plan:

```
../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-llm-api-gateway-integration-plan.md
```

Source repo (deprecating after Phase 8 cutover):

```
../../../../llm-api-gateway/proxy/src/
```

## Anvil Quickstart

Phase 3 introduces the Anvil harness and integration tests. The chain-write round-trip
(`depositX402` + `consumeCredits`) can be exercised locally against a fresh Anvil node
with the source repo's contracts deployed.

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed (`~/.foundry/bin/anvil` + `forge`).
- Source repo cloned at `../../../../llm-api-gateway/` relative to this package.
- No network access required — the tests use a fresh non-forked Anvil chain (chainId=31337).

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Build the source contracts (one-time, or after contract changes)
cd ../../../../llm-api-gateway/contracts
forge build

# 2. Run the full billing test suite including Anvil integration tests
cd ../../Tokamak-AI-Layer/tokagentos
BILLING_TEST_ANVIL=1 bun run test --filter=@tokagentos/billing
```

The integration suite takes ~15–20s when BILLING_TEST_ANVIL is set:
- Anvil process start: ~5s
- `forge script Deploy.s.sol --broadcast`: ~5s
- Vault read/write round-trips: ~6s

Without `BILLING_TEST_ANVIL=1`, integration tests are silently skipped.
The unit tests (EIP-3009 offline verify, typed-data shape) always run.

### Required env vars (chain layer)

The five chain-layer envs are required when `BILLING_ENABLED=true` (Phase 6).
For Phase 3 manual testing, pass them directly to `createBillingClients()`:

```
BILLING_CHAIN_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
BILLING_CHAIN_ID=31337
BILLING_VAULT_ADDRESS=<output from forge script>
BILLING_PTON_ADDRESS=<output from forge script>
BILLING_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

For TWAP reads (Ethereum mainnet only):
```
BILLING_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<your-key>
```

```

Billing is **opt-in**: set `BILLING_ENABLED=true` in your deployment's environment to activate.
Local-first and self-hosted deployments run with `BILLING_ENABLED=false` (the default) and are
entirely unaffected.
