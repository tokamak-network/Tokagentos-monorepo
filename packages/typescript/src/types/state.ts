 * The schema also controls validation behavior for streaming scenarios.
 *
 * Schema rows are intentionally backwards-compatible with the original flat shape,
 * but now also support nested objects and arrays so callers can describe structured
 * payloads without embedding pseudo-schemas in prose strings.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const schema: SchemaRow[] = [
 *   { field: 'thought', description: 'Your internal reasoning' },
 *   { field: 'text', description: 'Response to user', required: true },
 *   {
 *     field: 'facts',

 *     type: 'array',
 *     items: {
 *       description: 'One fact entry',
