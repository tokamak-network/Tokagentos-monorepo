/**
 * Advanced Capabilities
 *
 * Extended functionality that can be enabled with `enableExtendedCapabilities: true`
 * or `advancedCapabilities: true` in plugin initialization.
 *
 * These provide additional agent features:
 * - Extended providers (facts, contacts, relationships, roles, settings, knowledge, clipboard, form, personality)
 * - Advanced actions (contacts management, room management, image generation, clipboard, form, personality, etc.)
 * - Evaluators (reflection, relationship extraction, experience learning, form extraction, character evolution)
 * - Additional services (experience, clipboard, form, personality)
