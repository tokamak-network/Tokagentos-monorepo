/**
 * Edge runtime entry point for @elizaos/core (Vercel Edge, Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy).
 * Same API as node minus Node-only modules: character-loader, sessions, plugins discovery,
 * media, network/ssrf, services/hook, provisioning, utils/node.
 *
 * WHY separate entry: Edge runtimes cannot load Node APIs; provisioning uses process.env
 * and is not safe on edge. This keeps the bundle edge-compatible and avoids pulling
 * in code that would fail at runtime.
