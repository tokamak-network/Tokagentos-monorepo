/**
 * AGENT_INBOX — the agent's own mailbox / channel inbox.
 *
 * Distinct from OWNER_INBOX (which covers the OWNER's Gmail/Slack/Discord/SMS
 * etc.). AGENT_INBOX is scoped to the agent's OWN accounts — the mailbox the
 * agent itself holds for autonomous outbound and inbound.
 *
 * Currently a stub: returns `not_configured` when no agent mailbox is wired.
 * Placed in the registry now so the planner can see the distinction and we
 * have a clear landing spot when agent-mailbox integration is implemented.
