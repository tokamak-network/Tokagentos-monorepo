/**
 * Restart infrastructure for Eliza.
 *
 * Provides a pluggable restart handler so the restart action (and the
 * `/api/agent/restart` endpoint) work in every host environment:
 *
 *   - **CLI** (default): exits with {@link RESTART_EXIT_CODE} (75). The runner
 *     script (`eliza/packages/app-core/scripts/run-node.mjs`) catches this, rebuilds if source files
 *     changed, and relaunches.
 *   - **Dev-server / API**: the host registers a handler via
 *     {@link setRestartHandler} that stops the current runtime, creates a new
 *     one, and hot-swaps references.
 *   - **Desktop app**: the host registers a handler that calls
 *     `AgentManager.restart()`.
