# elizaOS

elizaOS is the plugin-based agent runtime that Eliza builds on top of.

## Read These References First

- `references/core-abstractions.md` for the runtime mental model and message flow
- `references/plugin-development.md` for plugin extension points and implementation patterns

## Use This Skill When

- a change touches `eliza/`
- you need to reason about `AgentRuntime`
- you are implementing or debugging actions, providers, evaluators, services, or model handlers
- you need the correct plugin lifecycle instead of guessing from Eliza wrappers

## Working Rules

- Treat the TypeScript runtime in `eliza/packages/typescript/src/` as the primary reference implementation.
- Prefer elizaOS-native abstractions over product-specific wrappers when reasoning about upstream behavior.
- Remember the split between persistent `Memory` and ephemeral `State`.
- Remember that plugins are the main composition mechanism.
