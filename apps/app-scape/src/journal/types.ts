/**
 * Scape Journal type definitions.
 *
 * The journal is the agent's long-term memory. Everything the LLM
 * should remember across sessions lives here: observations,
 * decisions, outcomes, goals, and progress milestones. It is
 * distinct from the xRSPS `player-state.json` save file (which
 * holds mechanical state — skills, inventory, bank) in that the
 * journal captures NARRATIVE state: what the agent learned, what
 * it wanted, what it achieved.
 *
 * The journal is stored on disk as **TOON**, not JSON — we want
 * the provider to be able to read the file directly and stream it
 * into the LLM prompt with zero transcoding overhead.
 *
 * Shape rules:
 *   - Every record has a stable `id` for dedup / update
 *   - Timestamps are Unix millis (Date.now())
 *   - String fields are short — this is context for an LLM, not
 *     a paragraph log
 *   - Arrays are bounded (recent memories are trimmed, abandoned
 *     goals are archived)
