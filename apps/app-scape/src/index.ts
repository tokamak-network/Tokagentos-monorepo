 * wires up the minimal route handler that serves the viewer iframe.
 *
 * PR 3+ will add `services`, `actions`, and `providers` so the LLM
 * runtime can drive an agent in the xRSPS world. Until then the plugin
 * is a pure launcher / viewer wrapper — clicking 'scape in the apps
 * view opens the xRSPS client in an iframe, and users can log in
 * themselves with a human account.
