/**
 * Scenario blueprints for synthetic training data generation.
 *
 * Each blueprint describes a canonical conversation scenario. The generator
 * expands each blueprint into multiple variants by randomizing:
 * - Agent name (prevents statistical name pollution)
 * - Participant names and count
 * - Platform (telegram, discord, slack, etc.)
 * - Tone, length, and distractor turns
 * - Context specificity (subtle → explicit)
 *
 * Blueprints are categorized by:
 * 1. Decision type: RESPOND | IGNORE | STOP
 * 2. Context domain: general, wallet, knowledge, etc.
 * 3. Conversation pattern: group_chat, group_noise, multi_turn_intent, etc.
