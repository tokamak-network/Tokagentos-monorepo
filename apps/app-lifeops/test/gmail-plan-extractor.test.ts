 * anything the extractor merely passes through from the stubbed JSON is
 * tautological and not worth asserting here.
 *
 * Only tests that exercise real branching or field-forcing logic in
 * `extractGmailPlanWithLlm` (skipping the payload pass, forcing defaults,
 * etc.) belong in this file. Tests that asserted equality with the mock's
 * own output have been removed.
