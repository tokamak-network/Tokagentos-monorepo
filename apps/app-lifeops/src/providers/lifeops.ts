        "Use LIFE for executable personal follow-through: todos, habits, goals, reminders, alarms, escalation, and live status questions like 'what's on my todo list today?'. Examples: 'add a todo', 'remember to call mom on Sunday', 'track my gym sessions three times a week', 'set a goal to save $5,000', or 'if I still haven't answered about those three events, bump me again with context instead of starting over'. Do not use REPLY, UPDATE_ENTITY, or UPDATE_OWNER_PROFILE for these.",
        "Use OWNER_CALENDAR for all owner calendar work: live calendar reads and writes, availability checks, proposing times, durable scheduling preferences, scheduling negotiation, and Calendly. Examples: 'what's my next meeting?', 'show me my calendar for today', 'what does my week look like?', 'schedule a dentist appointment next Tuesday at 3pm', 'am I free tomorrow afternoon?', 'propose three times for Marco next week', 'help me schedule with the design team', 'what Calendly event types do I have?', or 'no calls between 11pm and 8am unless I explicitly say it's okay'. Use OWNER_CALENDAR for scheduling preferences like sleep windows or no-call hours; do not send those to device-intent actions unless the user explicitly means phone/device ringing or alerts. Do not answer these from provider context alone.",
        "Use OWNER_INBOX for owner inbox and email work. It is the single umbrella for cross-channel inbox triage, inbox-only digests, reply workflows, and Gmail/email-specific search/read/draft/send. Examples: 'triage my Gmail inbox', 'summarize my unread emails', 'draft a reply to Sarah's latest email', 'send a reply to the last email from finance', 'triage my inbox', 'give me my inbox digest', 'respond to the messages that need an answer in my inbox', 'show me the urgent blockers first and separate them from low-priority inbound', 'repair that missed call and hold the note for my approval', or 'if direct relaying gets messy, suggest making a group chat handoff'. If the request explicitly says Gmail or email, OWNER_INBOX should use channel=gmail; if the user says 'my inbox' without narrowing to Gmail, OWNER_INBOX should use the unified cross-channel path. If channel, recipient, or participant details are missing but the request is clearly inbox-owned, still choose OWNER_INBOX and let it ask the minimum follow-up. If the owner is only venting or making an observation like 'I hate email', stay in chat instead of calling OWNER_INBOX.",
        "Use RUN_MORNING_CHECKIN / RUN_NIGHT_CHECKIN for start-of-day or end-of-day briefings, even when the output combines inbox, calendar, task review, and blocker status. Examples: 'run my morning check-in', 'morning review', 'morning brief', 'what matters today', 'give me my operating picture', 'give me my night check-in', 'night brief', 'day recap', or 'how did today go?'. These are umbrella action requests, not conversational replies and not a bundle of child lookups. Do not decompose them into OWNER_INBOX, OWNER_CALENDAR, LIST_ACTIVE_BLOCKS, or other narrower status actions just because the briefing may mention unread items, meetings, or blockers.",
        "Use PASSWORD_MANAGER for credential lookup and saved-login requests. Examples: 'look up my GitHub password', 'show me my saved logins for github.com', 'copy my AWS password to clipboard'. Do not surface raw secrets in chat.",
        "Use REQUEST_FIELD_FILL when the owner asks the browser extension to autofill a specific field on a trusted site, such as 'fill the password field on github.com using my password manager'.",
        "Use OWNER_RELATIONSHIP for Rolodex contacts, follow-ups, overdue follow-up review, threshold tuning, and days-since-contact questions. Examples: 'who are my closest contacts?', 'remind me to follow up with David next week', 'how long has it been since I talked to David?', 'who do I owe a follow-up to?', 'mark the David follow-up done', 'set David's follow-up threshold to 10 days'.",
        "Use OWNER_SCREEN_TIME for quantitative device/app/website usage questions. Examples: 'how much screen time have I used today?', 'break down my screen time by app this week', 'what websites did I spend the most time on?'. If the owner is only reflecting or venting like 'I spend too much time on my phone', stay in chat instead of calling OWNER_SCREEN_TIME.",
        "Use OWNER_APP_BLOCK for phone app blocking requests. Examples: 'block all games on my phone until 6pm', 'block the Slack app while I focus on deep work'. Use OWNER_WEBSITE_BLOCK for websites like reddit.com or youtube.com, not phone apps.",
        "Use SUBSCRIPTIONS for subscription audits, recurring membership reviews, cancellation requests, and cancellation-status checks. Examples: 'audit my subscriptions', 'cancel my Google Play subscription', 'unsubscribe from Netflix', 'what happened with that subscription cancellation?'. Use this instead of generic browser automation when the user is asking for subscription-specific work.",
        "Use EMAIL_UNSUBSCRIBE when the owner wants to stop promotional or newsletter email from a sender, like 'unsubscribe me from newsletters@medium.com' or 'scan my inbox for subscriptions'. This is email-list cleanup, not paid-service cancellation.",
        "Use DOSSIER for meeting-prep and person-background briefs. Examples: 'pull up a dossier on Satya Nadella', 'give me the background on the person I'm meeting next: Julia Chen', 'brief me for my next meeting'. Do not answer these from ENTITIES or memory alone when the user explicitly wants a brief or dossier.",
        "Use UPDATE_OWNER_PROFILE for stable owner-only profile details and reusable preferences. Examples: 'remember my name is Shaw', 'update my location to Los Angeles', 'remember that I'm partnered', or 'save my travel preferences'. When the owner asks you to remember or save one of these stable facts, call the action instead of replying with an acknowledgement. Do not use it for goals, todos, reminders, temporary plans, or live task state.",
        "Use BOOK_TRAVEL when the owner asks you to book a trip or queue a travel booking. Examples: 'book travel for me from San Francisco to New York next Thursday and Friday'.",
        "Use X_READ for X/Twitter reads and search: DMs, timeline, mentions, and topic search. Do not reply that X/Twitter access is unavailable when this action is available.",
        "Use OWNER_WEBSITE_BLOCK for fixed-duration or generic focus blocks like 'block twitter and reddit for 2 hours' or 'turn on a focus block for all social media sites'. Use BLOCK_UNTIL_TASK_COMPLETE only when the unblock condition is finishing a task, workout, or todo, like 'block x.com until I finish my workout'.",
        "Use PUBLISH_DEVICE_INTENT for multi-device reminders, push ladders, document-signing nudges, updated-ID interventions, and device-level warnings. Examples: 'for important meetings, remind me an hour before, ten minutes before, and right when they start on both my Mac and my phone', 'if missing this could trigger a cancellation fee, warn me clearly and offer to handle it now', or 'if the only ID on file is expired, ask me for an updated copy so the workflow can continue'. Use LIFEOPS_COMPUTER_USE for portal uploads, Finder/Desktop work like taking screenshots or creating folders, browser workflows, and file-handling tasks on the owner's machine, including future instructions like 'when I send over the deck, upload it to the portal for me.'",
        "Use MANAGE_LIFEOPS_BROWSER for browser-companion settings, listing tabs/sessions, and LifeOps browser control commands like 'show me my LifeOps browser settings'.",
        "Use OWNER_REMOTE_DESKTOP to start, list, check, end, or revoke a remote desktop session so the owner can connect from a phone. Requests like 'start a remote desktop session' or 'let me connect from my phone' belong here even if the action needs confirmation or a pairing step.",
        "Use APPROVE_REQUEST / REJECT_REQUEST when the owner is resolving a pending approval item. Examples: 'approve the pending travel booking request' or 'reject that pending approval request and say it needs changes'.",
        "Use CALL_USER or CALL_EXTERNAL for phone-call escalation or booking calls. These actions can draft or request confirmation first; they do not require the dial to happen on the first turn. Requests like 'if you get stuck in the browser or on my computer, call me and let me jump in to unblock it' belong to CALL_USER. Requests like 'call the dentist and reschedule my appointment' or 'phone my cable company about the outage' belong to CALL_EXTERNAL, not OWNER_CALENDAR, LIFE, or OWNER_SEND_MESSAGE.",
        "When the owner is only making an observation or venting like 'my calendar has been crazy this quarter', 'I hate email', or 'I think I spend too much time on my phone', stay in REPLY instead of calling a LifeOps action unless they actually ask you to do something.",
        "Treat owner instructions phrased as standing policies, triggers, or conditionals like 'if this happens, do x' or 'when that arrives, handle it' as executable requests, not hypotheticals.",
        "When the owner clearly asks for one of these LifeOps executive-assistant operations, call the best-fit action instead of staying in advice-only chat. If details are missing, let the action ask the minimum follow-up question.",
        "Route examples: sleep/no-call windows -> OWNER_CALENDAR(update_preferences); inbox digest / missed-call repair / Gmail reply drafts / group-chat handoff / event asset checklist -> OWNER_INBOX; morning brief / operating picture / what matters today -> RUN_MORNING_CHECKIN; night brief / recap / end-of-day review -> RUN_NIGHT_CHECKIN; stable owner facts or travel preference memory -> UPDATE_OWNER_PROFILE; bulk partnership reschedule or flight-conflict handling -> OWNER_CALENDAR; clinic-doc reminders / updated-ID interventions / multi-device meeting ladders / cancellation-fee warnings -> PUBLISH_DEVICE_INTENT; portal upload or browser filing -> LIFEOPS_COMPUTER_USE; if the agent gets stuck and should phone the owner -> CALL_USER.",
